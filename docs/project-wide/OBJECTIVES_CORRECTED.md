1.3. Objectives

	1.3.1. General Objectives

The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a fully functional Laundry Point of Sale (POS) and Management System that automates and centralizes the daily operations of a laundry shop. The system aims to replace traditional manual processes with a streamlined digital platform that reduces human error, speeds up service, and improves overall operational accuracy. It is designed for laundry shop owners, administrators, and staff who manage transactions, process orders, and maintain service records.

In general, the project seeks to create an easy-to-use, web-based and mobile-based management system that integrates POS processing, order tracking, service management, and record management into one unified interface. The system consists of two main applications: a web-based admin interface accessible through modern browsers for administrators and owners, and a mobile application for staff members running on iOS and Android devices. The system will be developed using core computing concepts such as modular programming, database management, CRUD operations, authentication, and data validation. It utilizes modern web technologies including React and TypeScript for the admin web application, React Native with Expo for the mobile staff application, Node.js with Express for the backend API server, and MongoDB as the database platform to ensure secure and reliable data handling. The system requires server infrastructure with minimum specifications (2GB RAM, 2 CPU cores) and stable internet connectivity to operate effectively, while the admin interface can be accessed from standard desktop or laptop computers with modern web browsers, and the staff application runs on standard mobile devices.

Overall, this system provides a centralized and efficient solution that enhances workflow, supports informed decision-making, and ensures accurate and organized operations inside the laundry shop. By offering real-time access to records, automated data processing, and simplified management tools accessible from both desktop browsers and mobile devices, the system ultimately contributes to improved service quality and smoother business operations.

	1.3.2. Specific Objectives

	To achieve the development and implementation of the Laundry POS and Management System, the following milestones and steps will be undertaken:

Develop a Centralized POS Platform

Create a system that enables staff to process transactions, manage orders, and organize customer records efficiently through both web and mobile interfaces, with real-time synchronization across all platforms.

Implement a User-Friendly Interface

Design intuitive and easy-to-navigate interfaces for both the web-based admin application and mobile staff application to ensure smooth interaction for owners, administrators, and staff with varying technical skills.

Automate Order Tracking and Management

Develop features that allow real-time updating of order status—from receiving, washing, drying, up to releasing—to minimize delays and prevent misplaced items. The system tracks order progress through multiple status stages (Pending, In Progress, Ready for Pickup, Completed) and provides notifications for status changes.

Integrate Service Management

Build modules that allow administrators to manage laundry services, pricing structures, and discount codes. The system tracks service usage through orders and provides analytics on service popularity and revenue generation, enabling data-driven business decisions.

Generate Real-Time Reports

Provide tools that allow administrators and owners to view sales summaries, revenue analytics, customer statistics, and daily operational performance through interactive dashboards and exportable reports (PDF, Excel, CSV formats) for decision-making.

Ensure Data Security and Role-Based Access

Implement secure authentication using JWT tokens and authorization mechanisms with role-based access control (RBAC) to protect sensitive records and assign appropriate system privileges to each user role (admin and staff), ensuring that users only access features and data relevant to their responsibilities.

Conduct System Testing and User Training

Perform comprehensive system testing to guarantee reliability and functionality across all platforms and use cases. Train staff and administrators to ensure proper system use and adoption, maximizing the benefits of the digital platform.

Provide a Scalable and Maintainable Solution

Develop a flexible system architecture using modular design patterns that allows future enhancements such as additional features, service categories, multi-branch expansion, or integration with external payment gateways, ensuring the system can grow with the business.

By accomplishing these objectives, the Laundry POS and Management System will streamline shop operations, improve accuracy, and deliver a secure, efficient, and well-organized digital workflow for laundry businesses accessible from both desktop and mobile platforms.
