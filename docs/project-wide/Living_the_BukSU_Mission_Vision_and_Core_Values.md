Living the BukSU Mission, Vision, and Core Values in My Own Life

Mission Connection

I am inspired by BukSU's mission to develop ethical and innovative leaders for sustainable global development. I view my education as an opportunity to create positive change, not just achieve good grades. I practice leadership by taking initiative in group assignments and helping struggling classmates. I approach assignments creatively, seeking innovative solutions and out-of-the-box ideas in research. My ethical beliefs guide all decisions, maintaining academic honesty, respecting everyone, and standing against injustice.

Vision Alignment

As a professional dedicated to creating quality life for all, I align with BukSU's vision. I plan to implement sustainable practices that minimize environmental impact, promote social equity, and support economic viability. My goal is to raise industry standards while advocating for innovative solutions that create lasting positive impact on communities, ecosystems, and global networks.

Core Values Application

Excellence and Integrity form the foundation of my academic and personal success. Excellence means exceeding minimum requirements. In group projects, I contribute thorough research and creative solutions. I study to master content, not just achieve grades. I support classmates through collaboration and show respect to teachers through active participation and thoughtful questions. When volunteering, I always give my best effort.

Integrity means aligning actions with values. Academically, I never compromise honesty, complete work independently, cite sources properly, and admit when I don't understand something. In relationships, I keep commitments, communicate honestly about challenges, and take responsibility for mistakes. I address conflicts directly and follow through on community commitments.

Personal Commitment

As a BukSU student, I pledge to be an innovative leader who approaches challenges creatively, an ethical individual who makes moral decisions, and a competitive professional committed to sustainability and excellence. I will use these principles as a framework guiding my choices, evaluating whether my actions demonstrate innovation, ethical leadership, and contribution to sustainable development.

I will carry these values throughout my career, remaining a lifelong learner while staying true to BukSU graduate principles. I understand that becoming a responsible professional and citizen is a continuous journey. I commit to this path, knowing that by following these principles, I contribute to creating a better world for all.
